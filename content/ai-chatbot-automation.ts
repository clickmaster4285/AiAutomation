      heading: 'Why Old Chatbots Failed — and What Changed',
      content: [
        'The first generation of chatbots earned their bad reputation honestly. They ran on rigid decision trees: a fixed set of buttons and pre-written paths. If a customer phrased something in a way the designer had not anticipated, the bot was lost. It could not understand intent, only match keywords, so it constantly misread what people meant. Worst of all, it stood between the customer and a human, turning a simple question into a frustrating maze. Everyone has hammered "speak to a representative" into one of these, and the memory is why so many people distrust the word "chatbot."',
        'What changed is the underlying technology. Modern AI chatbots are built on large language models that genuinely understand natural language. A customer can ask in their own words, in any phrasing, and the bot grasps what they actually mean. More importantly, the best ones answer from your real content — your help docs, product information, and policies — rather than a small set of canned responses, and they can take action in your systems rather than only talking. The result is a conversation that feels like talking to someone helpful, not navigating a phone tree from 2010.',
        'The honest caveat: this is only true when the bot is built well. A modern model plugged in carelessly, without grounding in your content and without clear escalation paths, can still produce a poor experience — confidently wrong answers instead of confidently unhelpful ones. The technology makes a great chatbot possible; the build determines whether you get one.'

      heading: 'What Modern AI Chatbots Can Actually Do',
      content: [
        'The leap from old to new is the leap from informing to acting. An old bot could, at best, show you an FAQ answer. A modern AI chatbot can carry out the task behind the question. It can look up an order and report its real status. It can check availability and book an appointment directly into your calendar. It can qualify a lead through natural conversation and route it to the right salesperson. It can answer a detailed product question from your documentation and, if the visitor is ready, move them toward a purchase or a booking.',
        'And when it reaches the edge of what it should handle — a complex complaint, a sensitive account issue, anything outside its remit — it hands off to a human with the full conversation attached, so the customer does not start over. That clean handoff is part of a good build, not an afterthought. The goal is not a bot that refuses to let you reach a person; it is a bot that resolves what it can and connects you smoothly when it cannot.'

      content: [
        'The single biggest risk with an AI chatbot is that it answers confidently and wrongly — telling a customer something that simply is not true for your business. This is exactly what we engineer against, and the core technique is grounding. Rather than letting the model answer from its general training, we connect it to your real content — your help center, product information, and policies — and have it answer from that. This is retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG, and it is the difference between a bot you can put in front of customers and one you cannot.',
        'We layer additional safeguards on top: guardrails defining what the bot may and may not discuss, clear escalation to humans for sensitive topics, and monitoring so problems surface early and the bot improves over time. Where your content does not cover something, a well-built bot says so and offers to connect the customer to a person, rather than inventing a plausible-sounding answer to seem helpful. Accuracy is a design choice, and we make it deliberately.',
        'A useful byproduct: building a grounded chatbot exposes the gaps and contradictions in your own documentation, because the bot can only be as good as the content behind it. Many clients find their knowledge base — and therefore their human support too — improves as a direct result of getting the bot right.'
