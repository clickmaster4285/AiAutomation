        'SaaS growth is wonderful until it overwhelms the systems around it. More users mean more support tickets, and a large share are repetitive how-do-I questions. More signups mean more onboarding, and onboarding quality directly drives activation and retention — yet doing it well at scale by hand is impossible. Churn creeps in, often with warning signs buried in usage data that no one has time to watch. Revenue operations — billing, CRM, reporting — grow more complex and consume more manual effort.',
        'The SaaS model rewards efficient scaling: the goal is to grow revenue much faster than cost. But if every increment of growth requires proportional increases in support staff, onboarding effort, and operational headcount, that efficiency erodes. Automation is how successful SaaS companies preserve it — absorbing the repetitive support, automating onboarding, surfacing churn signals, and streamlining revenue ops, so the business scales on software rather than on hiring.',
