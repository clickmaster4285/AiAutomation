        'E-commerce generates relentless repetitive work that scales directly with sales. Customer support tickets — where is my order, what is your return policy, does this come in another size — arrive constantly and are mostly variations on a handful of questions. Orders need processing, status updates, and exception handling. Carts are abandoned at high rates and need recovery. Marketing — emails, campaigns, lifecycle messaging — needs constant feeding. For a small team, this volume is overwhelming, and it grows with every increase in traffic and sales.',
        'The trap is that handling this manually ties your operational capacity to headcount: more sales means more support, more order issues, more everything, requiring more people. Automation breaks that link, absorbing the repetitive volume so your team\'s size is driven by genuinely complex work rather than sheer quantity. This is how lean e-commerce teams punch far above their weight — they automate the operational layer that would otherwise consume them.',

We start with whichever is consuming your team or costing you the most revenue today and expand from there.',
