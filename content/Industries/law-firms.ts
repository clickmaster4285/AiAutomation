        'Legal work is wrapped in administration. New clients need intake and onboarding. Documents need drafting, often from templates and repeated information. Deadlines and matter statuses need tracking, with serious consequences if something is missed. Clients need updates and follow-up. Much of this is repetitive and time-consuming, and because attorney time is expensive, every hour spent on administration rather than billable legal work is costly twice over.',
        'The stakes also make consistency essential. A missed deadline, a dropped follow-up, an intake that fell through the cracks — these are not just inefficiencies in a law firm; they carry real risk. Automation brings consistency to exactly these areas: intake that always happens, deadlines that are always tracked and flagged, follow-up that never slips. It removes both the time cost and the risk of human inconsistency from the administrative layer, while leaving the legal substance to the professionals.',

        'This boundary matters more in law than almost anywhere, so we are explicit about it. Automation in a law firm handles administration and drafting support — it gathers intake information, assembles draft documents from templates and data, tracks deadlines, and manages routine client communication. What it does not do is exercise legal judgment. Every document it drafts is for attorney review before it is used. Every legal decision remains with the lawyers.',
        'AI document drafting, in particular, should be understood correctly: it accelerates the production of routine documents by assembling them from your templates and the matter\'s information, saving substantial time. But it produces drafts, not final legal work, and an attorney reviews and takes responsibility for what goes out. Used this way — as a drafting accelerator with professional review — it is a genuine efficiency gain. Treated as a replacement for legal judgment, it would be a serious mistake, and we build the workflow to keep that line clear.',
