  description: 'Clickmasters builds chatbot on Salesforce. Salesforce is the enterprise CRM standard, with enormous capability that most orgs use a fraction of and it\'s an excellent fit for organizations with Salesforce at the core of revenue operations. Combined with chatbot, which holds real conversations and takes real action answering from your own content, booking appointments, qualifying leads, and handing off to humans cleanly. Modern AI chatbots understand natural language and ground their answers in your actual documentation, which makes them nothing like the scripted bots everyone learned to dread, the result is automation that runs on a platform matched to the job.',

    'Why Salesforce for AI Chatbots': 'Salesforce is the enterprise CRM standard, with enormous capability that most orgs use a fraction of. Automation and ai extend what admins can build natively. For chatbot specifically, that means your automation gets the platform strengths while we handle the design, build, and reliability engineering that separates a production system from a fragile demo.\n\nWe\'re platform-honest: if your volume, data requirements, or complexity actually point to a different platform, we\'ll say so. Salesforce is the right home for this work when it matches organizations with Salesforce at the core of revenue operations and when it does, this combination is hard to beat.',
    'What We Build': '**Grounded Q&A (RAG)** answers drawn from your real content, so responses are accurate and on-brand, built on Salesforce.\n**Lead qualification in conversation** visitors engaged, qualified, and captured naturally, built on Salesforce.\n**Booking and scheduling** appointments checked and booked directly in chat, built on Salesforce.\n**Action-taking** lookups, updates, and processes executed, not just described, built on Salesforce.\n**Clean human handoff** complex cases escalated with full context attached, built on Salesforce.',
    'What a Production Build Includes': 'The gap between a demo and a system you can rely on is everything that happens when things go wrong. Every chatbot build we ship on Salesforce includes error handling on every step (failures caught and retried or escalated, never silent), monitoring and alerting (you know the system is running without checking), documentation (your team can understand and modify the build), and staged rollout (the automation proves itself on real cases with human oversight before it runs unattended).\n\nThis is the difference between automation that saves hours and automation that quietly breaks and costs trust. Most of the rescue projects we take on are builds that skipped these steps.',
    'Typical Workflows on Salesforce': 'The chatbot workflows we most often build on Salesforce follow a consistent pattern: an event triggers (a form fill, an inbound message, a record change, a schedule), the workflow gathers context from your systems, AI handles the judgment step where one is needed classification, extraction, drafting and the result is executed and logged. Salesforce\'s strengths make it particularly suited to organizations with Salesforce at the core of revenue operations, and the platform\'s ecosystem means your existing tools almost certainly connect without custom code.',
    'How We Work': '1. **Free audit** we map the workflow and confirm Salesforce is genuinely the right platform for it.\n2. **Build in sprints** constructed against your real tools and data, with error handling and monitoring built in.\n3. **Documented hand-off** you own the build; nothing is a black box.\n4. **Optimize** we monitor, refine, and expand as the system proves itself.',
