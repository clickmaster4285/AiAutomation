A lead arrives, gets enriched, scored, routed, and followed up — without anyone copying data from one tab to another. That is a workflow, and when it runs by hand it is slow, inconsistent, and quietly expensive in ways most businesses never measure.',
        'This page covers what AI workflow automation actually is, how it differs from the basic automation you may already use, the specific kinds of workflows we build, the platforms we build them on and why we choose between them, a set of worked examples so you can see the shape of the work, and an honest guide to deciding which of your processes is worth automating first. By the end you should be able to look at your own operation and spot the workflows that are costing you the most.'

    // ========== TEXT: What Is AI Workflow Automation? ==========
    {
      type: 'text',
      heading: 'What Is AI Workflow Automation?',
      content: [
        'A workflow is everything that has to happen between a trigger and a result. The trigger might be a form submission, a new deal created, an incoming email, a paid invoice, or simply a scheduled time of day. The result might be a booked meeting, an updated record, a sent invoice, a generated report, or a resolved ticket. Between those two points sits a chain of steps — and in most businesses, a person is performing those steps manually, one at a time, whenever they get to them.',
        'Workflow automation runs that chain for you. The distinction worth understanding is between basic, rule-based automation and AI workflow automation. Basic automation follows fixed instructions: when X happens, do Y. It is genuinely useful for simple, predictable steps — move this record, send that notification. But it breaks the moment a step requires reading something unstructured, interpreting intent, or deciding between several possible paths.',
        'AI workflow automation adds a reasoning layer on top of that plumbing. The system can read an unstructured message, classify what it is, extract the important details, draft a relevant response, decide which branch of the process applies, and handle the messy, real-world cases that rigid rules cannot. That difference is what allows automation to move beyond simple triggers into work that previously required human judgment.',
        'Here is the difference made concrete. A rule-based automation can take a lead from a web form and create a contact in your CRM. An AI workflow can read the lead\'s actual message, work out what they are really asking for, score how well they match your ideal customer, write a genuinely relevant first reply rather than a generic template, route them to the right salesperson based on the content, and then continue or adjust the follow-up sequence depending on whether and how they respond. One moves data. The other does the thinking a person used to do.'

    // ========== TEXT: Why Manual Workflows Cost More Than They Look ==========
    {
      type: 'text',
      heading: 'Why Manual Workflows Cost More Than They Look',
      content: [
        'The cost of a manual workflow is easy to underestimate because it is spread across hundreds of small moments. Thirty seconds copying a field here. Two minutes checking a status there. Five minutes reformatting a report. A few minutes hunting for the right piece of information before you can even start. Each instance is individually trivial, which is exactly why it never gets measured. In aggregate, though, it adds up to a part-time job that nobody was ever hired to do — performed in fragments by people who were hired to do something more valuable.',
        'There is a second, larger cost that is even easier to miss: manual workflows leak. A human forgets the day-three follow-up. Someone mistypes a number when transferring it between systems. A step gets skipped when things are busy. The lead that arrives at nine in the evening sits unanswered until morning, by which point a competitor who automated their response has already replied. Every one of these leaks is a real cost — a lost deal, a billing error that takes hours to untangle, a customer who quietly churns because the experience felt slow. Automated workflows do not get tired, distracted, or overwhelmed. They run the same way every single time, at any hour, including the hours your team is asleep.',
        'The third cost is the one that matters most if you are trying to grow: manual workflows do not scale. Double your lead volume, your order volume, or your ticket volume, and you need roughly double the people performing the manual steps. The manual approach ties your capacity directly to your headcount. Automate the workflow and you can often handle several times the volume with the same team, because the system absorbs the increase. For a business trying to scale efficiently, that is the entire point — growth that does not require hiring in lockstep.',
        'When we run an automation audit, this is what we are really hunting for: the workflows where these three costs — accumulated time, leakage, and the inability to scale — are highest. Those are almost never the flashy, interesting processes. They are the boring, high-volume, universally disliked ones that everyone assumes simply have to be done by hand.'
