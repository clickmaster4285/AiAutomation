AI data and document automation extracts, validates, and routes this work automatically — combining OCR to read documents with AI to understand them.',

      heading: 'The Hidden Cost of Manual Data and Document Work',
      content: [
        'Document and data-entry work is the archetypal hidden cost. It rarely appears as a line item; it\'s absorbed into the day of finance staff, operations people, and admins as a constant background tax. Reading each invoice and typing the details into accounting. Transcribing form submissions. Reconciling figures across systems by eye. Cleaning data so a report will actually work. It feels like "just part of the job," which is exactly why it\'s never measured and never questioned.',
        'It\'s also error-prone in a way that compounds. Manual data entry has a well-documented error rate, and errors in financial and operational data are expensive to find and fix downstream — a transposed figure in an invoice, a mistyped field in a record, propagating through reports and decisions until someone notices something doesn\'t add up. The cost isn\'t just the entry time; it\'s the time spent later hunting for and correcting the mistakes.',

    {
      type: 'text',
      heading: 'How Modern Document Extraction Differs From Old OCR',
      content: [
        'Many businesses tried document automation years ago with traditional OCR and found it disappointing — it could read clean, perfectly formatted text but fell apart on real-world documents with varied layouts, and it had no understanding of what the text meant. You still needed a person to check and correct nearly everything, which defeated the purpose.',
        'Modern AI-based extraction is a different proposition. It combines OCR with language models that understand documents, so it can find the invoice total even when invoices come in dozens of different layouts, distinguish a date from an invoice number from a PO number by meaning rather than position, and handle the messy variety of real documents. Instead of reading characters blindly, it understands the document the way a person does — which is what finally makes document automation reliable enough to remove the manual work rather than just relocate it.',

        'This is the fair question, and the honest answer is: modern AI extraction is highly accurate on typical business documents, and crucially, it\'s built to know when it\'s unsure. The right way to deploy it isn\'t to assume perfection and hope — it\'s to combine strong extraction with validation rules and a human-in-the-loop step for exceptions. The system handles the high-confidence majority automatically and routes the genuinely ambiguous cases to a person, with the specific uncertain field flagged.',
        'That design is what makes it trustworthy for financial and operational data. You\'re not choosing between "all manual" and "fully automated and hope it\'s right." You\'re getting automation that handles the bulk of the volume cleanly and escalates the small remainder it isn\'t sure about — which means the error rate in practice is typically lower than manual entry, not higher, because tired humans make mistakes on routine documents that a system flags for checking.',
