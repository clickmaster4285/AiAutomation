      content: [
        'In most organizations, the information people need to do their jobs is scattered: across documents in a shared drive, pages in a wiki, threads in Slack, policies in a PDF nobody can find, and — most fragile of all — in the heads of a few long-tenured colleagues. Finding an answer means searching several systems, interrupting a coworker, or simply guessing. Studies of knowledge work consistently find that a meaningful share of every week is lost to searching for information that already exists somewhere in the company.',
        'The costs compound in ways that are easy to miss. New hires take longer to become productive because they do not yet know where anything lives or whom to ask. Experienced staff are constantly interrupted to answer the same questions. Knowledge walks out the door when a key person leaves. And decisions get made on stale or half-remembered information because finding the current, correct answer was too much friction in the moment.',
        'An AI knowledge assistant addresses this directly. It indexes your internal knowledge and answers questions from it instantly, in natural language, so the right answer is a question away rather than a search-and-interrupt expedition. The knowledge stops being trapped and starts being available.'

      content: [
        'A knowledge assistant is an internal-facing AI that answers from your company\'s own content. It is not a public chatbot for customers, and it is not a general-purpose model that answers from the open internet. Its entire value comes from being grounded in your specific, internal, often confidential information — your processes, your policies, your product details, your accumulated documentation — and answering only from that.',
        'This grounding is what makes it trustworthy and useful. When an employee asks how a particular process works, what the policy is on something, or where to find a piece of information, the assistant retrieves the relevant content from your real documents and answers based on it, citing or pointing to the source. It is not guessing or generalizing; it is surfacing what your organization actually knows. Where the answer is not in your content, a well-built assistant says so rather than inventing one.'

      content: [
        'Internal knowledge is sensitive, so security is central, not an afterthought. We build knowledge assistants with proper access controls — so people see only what they are permitted to — and, where data sensitivity demands it, on self-hostable infrastructure so your information stays entirely within your environment rather than flowing to a third party. The assistant is scoped to your content and your permissions, nothing more.',
        'Accuracy comes from the same grounding principle that makes customer-facing AI trustworthy: retrieval-augmented generation. The assistant answers from your actual documents rather than from a model\'s general training, and it can point to the source so an employee can verify and read further. Where your content does not contain an answer, the assistant says so instead of fabricating one — which matters even more internally than externally, because staff act on these answers directly.',
        'As with support bots, building a knowledge assistant tends to improve the underlying knowledge itself. Gaps, contradictions, and out-of-date documents become visible because the assistant surfaces them, giving you a clear picture of where your internal documentation needs attention.'
